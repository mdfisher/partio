# works that you create.

# conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
# worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made,
# use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the
# software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.

# 3. Conditions and Limitations
# (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
# contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
# (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim
# are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the
# software ends automatically.

# patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.

# so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your
# distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code
# form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.
# (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The contributors
# give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional
# consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
